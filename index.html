    title="Penn State University's Westgate Building"
    source="https://ist.psu.edu/sites/default/files/featured/contact.jpg">
    <p>"The Penn State Westgate Building, originally opened in 2004 as the Information Sciences and Technology Building
      and later renamed in 2017 to better reflect its role as both a home for the College of Information Sciences and
      Technology (IST) and a shared space with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, is one of
      the most striking and ambitious architectural landmarks on the University Park campus, designed by Rafael Viñoly
      Architects in collaboration with Perfido Weiskopf Architects as a massive structure that quite literally bridges
      Atherton Street, symbolizing connection while also physically linking east and west campus; inspired by Florence’s
      Ponte Vecchio, the 199,000-square-foot, \$58.8 million complex feels part academic hub, part campus gateway,
      offering classrooms with advanced telecommunications and multimedia infrastructure, flexible research labs
      including a state-of-the-art three-dimensional immersive visualization environment, a 155-seat “cybertorium” for
      lectures and presentations, open study lounges and collaboration spaces, faculty and staff offices, and a newly
      renovated academic services suite designed to better serve a growing student population, while at the same time
      creating a distinctive experiential atmosphere through its use of light, glass, and sweeping interior corridors
      that give students and faculty views of both the surrounding landscape and the city streets below; though
      initially criticized for its confusing navigation—having more than a dozen entrances and no clear “front door”—the
      Westgate Building has since been improved with better signage and wayfinding, yet it still retains a kind of
      maze-like intrigue that reflects both the complexity and interconnectedness of the disciplines it houses, making
      it not only a center for digital-age education and interdisciplinary research but also a symbol of Penn State’s
      embrace of innovation, collaboration, and architectural boldness.
